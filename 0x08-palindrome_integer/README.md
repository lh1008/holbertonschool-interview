# 0x08. Palindrome integer

### Tasks

_**0. Palindrome unsigned integer**_
Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.

### Compiling and instructions

This project was compiled on `Ubuntu 20.4 LTS`.  All functions were included in `palindrome.h`.

These were compiled using `GCC` (`gcc version 8.4.0`) using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`.

Download the project and locate yourself inside the directory where you downloaded it.

You can execute the executable by typing the following command:

`$ ./palindremo 121`

You should get the following returned message:

`121 is a palindrome`

If you want to compile the files and get the executable yourself, compile using the following command:

`gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -g3 -o palindrome 0-main.c 0-is_palindrome.c`

This will get the `0-main.c` and `0-is_palindrome.c` files and generate the executable `palindrome`.

Type the following command to execute and try the program:

`$ ./palindrome 78898987862563`

Enjoy!

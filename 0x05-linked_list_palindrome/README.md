# 0x05. Linked list palindrome

## Tasks

_**0. Linked list palindrome**_
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.

- Prototype: `int is_palindrome(listint_t **head);`
- Return: `0` if it is not a palindrome, `1` if it is a palindrome
- An empty list is considered a palindrome


Made another file `is_palindrome.c` where you can check the whole process in one file. Allocated memory for every linked list and freed at the end of the process. For compilation:

`gcc is_palindrome.c -o pal`
